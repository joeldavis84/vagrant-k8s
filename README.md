# vagrant-k8s
Vagrant Project for my LFS258 class. Other methods weren't working so I'll just install with kubeadm. This project probably isn't interesting to anyone outside of myself and one or two other people who might run into the same issues. Basically minikube wasn't installing at all unless I did VirtualBox. I could either do this as a Vagrant project or try to get the KVM driver working and so I did this just to get the ball rolling on the training class.
